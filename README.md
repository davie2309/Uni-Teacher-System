## Vision
The University System smart contract aims to revolutionize the way universities manage and track their faculty's performance, attendance, and professional growth. By leveraging blockchain technology, this system provides a transparent, decentralized, and tamper-proof solution that ensures the integrity of academic records and incentivizes good service through a token-based reward system.

## Contract Address
The smart contract is deployed on the Ethereum testnet at the following address: 0xd8b934580fcE35a11B58C6D73aDeE468a2833fa8





```
0xYourContractAddressHere
```

You can interact with the contract using this address in Remix or any other Ethereum-compatible environment.

## Features
- **Teacher Registry**: Register and manage teacher profiles, including their total classes taught and leave records.
- **Attendance Tracking**: Record daily attendance for teachers and monitor their overall performance.
- **Leave Management**: Allow teachers to apply for leave, automatically updating their records.
- **Promotion Criteria**: Evaluate teachers for promotions based on their performance and leave history.
- **Token Rewards**: Reward teachers with Service Tokens (STK) for their exemplary service.

## Future Scope
- **Integration with University Systems**: Connect the smart contract with existing university ERP systems for seamless data exchange.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Implement AI-based analytics to provide insights into teacher performance and student outcomes.
- **Decentralized Governance**: Introduce a governance model where decisions about promotions and rewards are made through decentralized voting.
- **Cross-University Compatibility**: Enable multiple universities to use the same contract with customized parameters.
- **NFT Credentials**: Issue NFT-based credentials for teachers' achievements, which can be publicly verified and showcased.
